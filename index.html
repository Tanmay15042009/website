I Live in Pune, Wakad, Western Avenue J-1001 and i have many friends in the society too. I like to play Games like Valorant and i also like to code. My first coding language is
HTML and CSS, I will learn Java Script too. My favourite outdoor game is Skating and Badminton. I have travelled to many places like Agra, Paris, Swisterland, Amsterdam,
Scotland and Spain. I have also been to London but I didn't visit it, I had lived there for 5 Years. Out of these my most favourites are Agra, Swisterland, Spain and a bit of
Paris too but it was always raining. So i had lived in India for my first 4 Years then i went to London and lived there for 5 Years and in that time i visited few other places
at that time too then i came back to india and now i am currently here in my society. My Freind Swayam also has a site like this and this is the link -->
